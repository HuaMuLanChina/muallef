# Conclusion

Great strides have been made in the field of Music Information
Retrieval pertaining to Automatic Music Transcription,
resulting in satisfactory results for certain underlying
tasks, namely onset detection and single pitch estimation.
Nevertheless, most AMT problems remain open as researchers
worldwide study and apply new concepts everyday.

In the scope of this project, we have explored well-established concepts
of onset detection and single pitch estimation, and succeeded in obtaining
satisfactory results.
We have as well explored two different approaches of multi-pitch estimation
and obtained relatively coherent results with Klapuri's method,
but unfortunally failed in applying Non-Negative Factorisation
as we hoped. 

As this is our second attempt in approaching AMT,
we have been able to study closely core concepts of AMT,
and explore deeply the core difficulty of AMT systems
that is *Multi-pitch Estimation*.
As research has lead us to studying several methods and approaches
to this problem, we had to restrict the study into two algorithms
that are robust, mathematically sound and appreciated by the MIR community.

I have held interest for this subject for quite some time,
partly because I am a violinist myself but also because
of my fondness of the employed mathematical principles.
Most importantly, this project requires application of various
mathematical notions as well as computer science skills
hence serving as a demonstration of acquired knowledge
throughout the Masters program.
This open problem is more suited as a PhD thesis subject or
as a research full-time focus, we have attempted to do as much
as we could to accomplish with very little time.
