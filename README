# MUALLEF

Muallef (ar: **مؤلف** pronounced *Mou'allef*) is a humble `python` open-source library that allows
analysing audio signals of music recordings.

The project is still work in progress, I aim to continue working on it as part of my Master's graduation
project.

I hope you find it useful, the project slideshow presentation and report (in French) are available on
the project website at rand-asswad.github.
